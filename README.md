## Installation
1. install anaconda 
2. create a new enviornment with python 3.7 and docopt

`conda create -n genie python=3.7 docopt=0.6.2`

3. activate the enviornment

`conda activate genie`

4. install snakemake

`conda install -c bioconda snakemake`

5. clone this full repository

`git clone https://github.com/drveera/mgenie.git`

6. the main script you need to call is `genie.py`. Add an alias to it. In my case, i added a line,

`alias genie="/home/users/veera/softwares/mgenie/genie.py`

to my ~/.bashrc file. 

7. After adding alias, source the bashrc file and activate the genie environment again (remember: everytime you source the bashrc file, you need to activate the genie environment, unless you have a line, `source activate genie`, in your bashrc file)

8. then type, `genie --help` and you should see the help message, then its done. If you didn't get the help message, repeat the steps 1-8 again. 

## General Instructions on running the pipeline

### Modules and sub-modules
The pipeline has many modules and sub-modules. 
For example, to run a run metaxcan analysis, you'll have to call the module predixcan and the submodule metax,

`genie predixcan metax -h`

*Note: Most of the modules are not ready for public. So it will probably not work for you now*

### submitting jobs
Every module will have an argument called `--cluster`. You can specify `--cluster minerva` or `--cluster genomedk` or `--cluster open`
according to where you are working. `open` means you are working in your own computer.

### running in the front end
Every module will have an argument called `--nojob`. when you call it, the jobs will not be submitted to cluster, but will run in front end. You can add another argument `--njobs` to specify how many jobs you should run in parallel, for example, `--njobs 4`. 
*Note: when you specify `--cluster open`, you should specify --nojob*

### --dry-run
you can view only the job plans without actually running them. use the argument `--dry-run`. It's a good practice to first check everything is ok by running the `--dry-run` and then submit the jobs. 
*Note: there are situations where the module will submit more than 10,000 jobs. in that case even the `--dry-run` will take 10-20 mins to finish displaying all the plans. it's better to avoid `--dry-run` there*
