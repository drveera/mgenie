Warning message:
In fread(sumstats.file) :
  C function strtod() returned ERANGE for one or more fields. The first was string input '1.1125944292536e-308'. It was read using (double)strtold() as numeric value 1.1125944292535998E-308 (displayed here using %.16E); loss of accuracy likely occurred. This message is designed to tell you exactly what has been done by fread's C code, so you can search yourself online for many references about double precision accuracy and these specific C functions. You may wish to use colClasses to read the column as character instead and then coerce that column using the Rmpfr package for greater accuracy.
